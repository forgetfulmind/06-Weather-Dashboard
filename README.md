# 06-Weather-Dashboard
Homework assignment #6 for CWRU Coding Bootcamp

For this assignment we were tasked the building of a weather forecast web application. When a user searches a city, they are presented with a single day and also a five day forecast. Along with this information, a history button is built so that user's can easily toggle between city searches. When a user returns to the site, the page has the button for the last searched city already appended to the page.
